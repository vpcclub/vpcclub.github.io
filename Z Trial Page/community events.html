			<h3>The George Howell Shield</h3>
			<h4>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Assumption College, Kilmore</h4>
			<p>Constable George Howell (10323) was stationed at Malvern East and on 30th January 1952 after swapping shifts he was to work from 5p.m. until 1:30a.m.  George had been assigned the task of patrolling the area surrounding the Crystal Palace Theatre in Dandenong Road, to combat escalating car theft. The heroic Officer attempted to follow his attacker before collapsing onto the roadway.  While George lay fighting for his life and thought of his loved ones he still managed to provide vital information to members at the scene.  At the hospital he provided a dying deposition and told Investigators everything he could about his assailant.  With his fiancé bedside, George went into Surgery.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately the following morning George died. He was only 25 years old.</p>
			<p>George’s funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Melbourne at that time with 3000 attendees.  Upon capture, George’s assailant was convicted of murder and his death sentence subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.George Howell was posthumously awarded the Kings Police Medal for ‘conspicuous gallantry in attempting the arrest of an armed criminal’.</p>
			<p>It is not known if George had any cricketing aspirations but later this same year the Russell Street Cricket Club struck the inaugural George Howell Shield during a match against Kilmore College in his honour. 50 years later it is not known whatever happened to the George Howell Shield or exactly how many matches were played after 1952.  What is now known is to be continued as a legacy to honour a colleague who missed the opportunities in life that we all take for granted.</p>
			<p>In recognition The Victoria Police Cricket Club has re-established the George Howell Shield as an annual fixture to be played against Assumption College Kilmore.</p>

			<h3>Kerrup-Inon-Marr Sheild</h3>
			<h4>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Cricket Victoria Imparja Cup Squad</h4>
			<p>The “kerrup-inon-marr” (meaning kinship and side-by-side) Shield is a community engagement event that commenced in February 2013 between the VPCC and the Victorian Imparja Cup Squad, which forms part of the Cricket Victoria Noogal Toengorrt Tani Cricket Program.

					<h2>Harmony in Cricket Cup</h2>
					<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Western Warriors Cricket Club</h3>


	<p>In 2015, a young male of Muslim faith was fatally shot outside the Endeavour Hills Police Station after he attacked two police officers with a knife. In the following days public sentiment focused on the negative aspect of the 
	Islamic faith and at times labelled all Muslims as extremists. In light of the tension within the community, the Victoria Police Cricket Club, in conjunction
	with Cricket Victoria’s Harmony in Cricket Program, developed an annual T20 cricket match, called the Harmony in Cricket Cup, which is aimed at improving the
	relationship between the police and the Islamic community of Melbourne through cricket, while also showing that regardless of religious beliefs, two groups can
	come together in the name of cricket. This annual match is played against the Western Warriors Cricket Club, a team of ex-pat Pakistaniand Indian Muslim 
	cricketers.</p>

      			<h2>The Luke Batty Memorial Shield</h2>
				<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Tyabb Cricket Club</h3>

	<p>In February 2016 the Victoria Police Cricket Club headed to Bunguyan Reserve in Tyabb, for the inaugural Luke Batty Memorial Shield, a T20
	cricket match against the Tyabb Cricket Club. The event was instigated by the VPCC to raise awareness of the issue of domestic violence in the community and also to honour the memory of Luke Batty who was killed by his father just over two years earlier whilst he trained in the nets with his
	friends and Tyabb CC team mates.</p>

	<p>The match gave the local community another chance to come together to
	remember Luke but also to celebrate the game of cricket. The VPCC are acutely aware of the issue of Family Violence and the impact it has on the local community and saw this event as a positive way to continue to raise awareness and encourage victims to take a stand and seek support. The match also allowed Police to interact with members of the Tyabb community in a positive environment.</p>

	<p>The match was attended by Luke’s mother and former Australian of the
	Year, Rosie Batty as well as senior Victoria Police staff. The match also
	attracted the support of Cricket Victoria, with a representative from the
	Melbourne Stars Women’s Big Bash League team on hand to present a cheque to
	the Luke Batty Foundation.</p>

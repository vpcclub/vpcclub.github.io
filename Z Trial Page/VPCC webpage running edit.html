 	 	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p class="Mission">The Victoria Police Cricket Club was initally formed in 1977 primarily to compete in what is now known as the Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships. Today, another function is to participate in community engagement events designed to enhance the relationship between Victoria Police and the wider community.</p>
		<p class="Mission">These events encourage camaraderie, physical fitness and goodwill amongst police members and project a favourable image of Victoria Police across the community by using cricket as a vehicle to engage with a cross-section of Victorians with a particular focus on culturally, linguistically and religiously diverse communities. Additionally we seek to to promote and encourage sportsmanship, a sense of fair play and the game of cricket itself.</p>
		<p class="Mission">Victoria Police Cricket Club was named the Most Outstanding Sports Club at Victoria Police Amateur Sports and Welfare Society Awards in 2015 and received the Police Media Multicultural Award at Victoria's Multicultural Awards for Excellence in 2016.</p>

			<h3>The George Howell Shield</h3>
			<h4>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Assumption College, Kilmore</h4>
			<p>Constable George Howell (10323) was stationed at Malvern East and on 30th January 1952 after swapping shifts he was to work from 5p.m. until 1:30a.m.  George had been assigned the task of patrolling the area surrounding the Crystal Palace Theatre in Dandenong Road, to combat escalating car theft. The heroic Officer attempted to follow his attacker before collapsing onto the roadway.  While George lay fighting for his life and thought of his loved ones he still managed to provide vital information to members at the scene.  At the hospital he provided a dying deposition and told Investigators everything he could about his assailant.  With his fiancé bedside, George went into Surgery.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately the following morning George died. He was only 25 years old.</p>
			<p>George’s funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Melbourne at that time with 3000 attendees.  Upon capture, George’s assailant was convicted of murder and his death sentence subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.George Howell was posthumously awarded the Kings Police Medal for ‘conspicuous gallantry in attempting the arrest of an armed criminal’.</p>
			<p>It is not known if George had any cricketing aspirations but later this same year the Russell Street Cricket Club struck the inaugural George Howell Shield during a match against Kilmore College in his honour. 50 years later it is not known whatever happened to the George Howell Shield or exactly how many matches were played after 1952.  What is now known is to be continued as a legacy to honour a colleague who missed the opportunities in life that we all take for granted.</p>
			<p>In recognition The Victoria Police Cricket Club has re-established the George Howell Shield as an annual fixture to be played against Assumption College Kilmore.</p>

			<h3>Kerrup-Inon-Marr Sheild</h3>
			<h4>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Cricket Victoria Imparja Cup Squad</h4>
			<p>The “kerrup-inon-marr” (meaning kinship and side-by-side) Shield is a community engagement event that commenced in February 2013 between the VPCC and the Victorian Imparja Cup Squad, which forms part of the Cricket Victoria Noogal Toengorrt Tani Cricket Program. This program is designed to provide participation and development opportunities for Indigenous Australians to participate in cricket. The Imparja Cup Squad is a team of highly talented Indigenous cricketers from across Victoria.</p>
			<p>The game is a way for the club, as representatives of Victoria Police, to enhance the sometimes strained relationship between police and Indigenous Australians. It also serves as match practice for the Imparja boys as they prepare for the Imparja Cup, an annual cricket tournament for Indigenous Australians held in the Northern Territory.</p>
			<p>In 2017, the Victorians took out the National title, be beating New South Wales by 18 runs.</p>

					<h2>Harmony in Cricket Cup</h2>
					<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Western Warriors Cricket Club</h3>


	<p>In 2015, a young male of Muslim faith was fatally shot outside the Endeavour Hills Police Station after he attacked two police officers with a knife. In the following days public sentiment focused on the negative aspect of the 
	Islamic faith and at times labelled all Muslims as extremists. In light of the tension within the community, the Victoria Police Cricket Club, in conjunction
	with Cricket Victoria’s Harmony in Cricket Program, developed an annual T20 cricket match, called the Harmony in Cricket Cup, which is aimed at improving the
	relationship between the police and the Islamic community of Melbourne through cricket, while also showing that regardless of religious beliefs, two groups can
	come together in the name of cricket. This annual match is played against the Western Warriors Cricket Club, a team of ex-pat Pakistaniand Indian Muslim 
	cricketers.</p>


      			<h2>The Luke Batty Memorial Shield</h2>
				<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Tyabb Cricket Club</h3>

	<p>In February 2016 the Victoria Police Cricket Club headed to Bunguyan Reserve in Tyabb, for the inaugural Luke Batty Memorial Shield, a T20
	cricket match against the Tyabb Cricket Club. The event was instigated by the VPCC to raise awareness of the issue of domestic violence in the community and also to honour the memory of Luke Batty who was killed by his father just over two years earlier whilst he trained in the nets with his
	friends and Tyabb CC team mates.</p>

	<p>The match gave the local community another chance to come together to
	remember Luke but also to celebrate the game of cricket. The VPCC are acutely aware of the issue of Family Violence and the impact it has on the local community and saw this event as a positive way to continue to raise awareness and encourage victims to take a stand and seek support. The match also allowed Police to interact with members of the Tyabb community in a positive environment.</p>

	<p>The match was attended by Luke’s mother and former Australian of the
	Year, Rosie Batty as well as senior Victoria Police staff. The match also
	attracted the support of Cricket Victoria, with a representative from the
	Melbourne Stars Women’s Big Bash League team on hand to present a cheque to
	the Luke Batty Foundation.</p>

					
					<h2>Harmony In Cricket Asylum Seeker Cup</h2>
			<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Monash Health Service Asylum Seekers</h3>

	<p>In 2017 the VPCC, in partnership with the Monash Health, Refugee Health and
	Wellbeing Program developed a community engagement event aimed at bringing
	police and refugees together through cricket to break down barriers and
	strengthen relationships between members of Victoria Police and Refugees and
	Asylum Seekers.</p>



				<h2>Emergency Services Mental Health Awareness Cup suporting beyondblue</h2>
				<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Metropolican Fire Brigade Cricket Club</h3>

	<p>In recent years, the club has come together with the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Cricket Club (MFBCC) in an effort to raise awareness of depression and
	suicide amongst Emergency Service Personnel. The match also helped to raise valuable funds for beyondblue which is undertaking consideralbe work to develop a package of resources to assist emergency service workers to both prevent and better deal with mental health issues. With the help of The Police Association and beyondblue, both the VPCC and the MFBCC hope to grow this 
	event well into the future and ensure this important issue is addressed</p>




				<h2>VPCC “Police In Schools” Program</h2>

	<p>Each year the club participates in a number of one-day matches (40 or 45 over per side) against various secondary schools and colleges around Victoria. This is designed to strengthen relationships with the younger members of the community by interacting with them in a positive environment. There are annual matches against Mentone Grammar and Assumption College Kilmore. The Club is pursuing partnership opportunities for these school events with not for profit organsiations to create and educational and support elements to these games relevant to school age students such as anti-bullying and cyber safety</p>



			<H2>Other Community Engagement Activities</H2>

	<p>In the past the Victoria Police Cricket Club has also competed in cricket matches against the Brimbank Community XI and the Indigos Cricket Team, both of which are designed improve the relationship between Victoria Police and the community within Victoria and allows us to interact with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities in a positive environment. The Victoria Police Cricket Club looks forward to continuing these events into the future.</p>

		  <h1>Membership</h1>
		  <h2> Eligibility</h2>


	<p>The Victoria Police Cricket Club playes in a range of locations and varying cricket formats throughout the summer months. The club is available to all sworn and unsworn members of Victoria Police regardless of rank or position and there is no pre-requisite level to have played in order to be considered for team selection.</p>

	<p> Membership fees are minimal, but are vital for the survival of the club. Each new member is asked to pay an initial fee of $50 (which includes a playing
	shirt and cap) in their first season and $20 each season thereafter.  All financial members of the club are eligible for selection in any event the club 
	participates in.< For those selected to represent Victoria Police at the Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships there are addition fees involved which varies depending on travel and accomodation costs.</p>


			


		<h2>Life Members</h2>

		<p> The greatest honour that can be bestowed upon any person from any club is that of Life Membership.  Formal recognition by the organisation and
		executive of an individual’s contribution, outstanding service or excellence is a most worthy achievement.  The Victoria Police Cricket Club is a
		reflection of the selfless commitment and time these generous individuals have donated over a lengthy period of time. In 40 years only nine members have 
		been awarded this accolade.  This honour is similarly treasured by those most worthy recipients.</p>

		    <ul>
			<li>Steve Johnson 1988/1989</li>
			<li>Lionel Allemand 1989/1990</li>
			<li>Ian Fountain 1989/1990</li>
			<li>Mick Shaw 1994/1995</li>
			<li>Wayne Stokes 1995/1996</li>
			<li>Stewart McConachy 1995/1996</li>
			<li>Dave Jakobi  2004/2005</li>
			<li>John O'Conner  2004/2005</li>
			<li>Warran Ladgrove  2006/2007</li>
			<li>Steve Rainey</li>
		    </ul>
					

<p>The first member to be awarded Life Membership to the Victoria Police Cricket Club was Steve Johnson in 1988/89.  He was the clubs first Secretary and Treasurer holding these positions for five years and three years respectively.  Steve was club captain in 1982/83.</p>

<p>Lionel Allemand and Ian ‘Bluey’ Fountain were both awarded life membership the following season in 1989/90.  Lionel was the inaugural President of the VPCC and maintained this position for seven seasons.  Bluey was Vice President in 1985/86 and later became President in 1991/92 for six seasons.  It would be no exaggeration to say that Steve, Lionel and Bluey are responsible for the structure of the club today.</p>

<p>In 1985/86 Mick Shaw became the Treasurer and held this executive position for four years, when in 1989/90 he relinquished this role for that of Secretary.  Mick held this position for six seasons and was subsequently awarded Life Membership in 1994/95, his last year filling an executive position.  The club’s success and strength is indebted to the tireless work Mick contributed over these 10 years, not to mention the on-going support and sponsorship he continually provides the club since his resignation from the Force some years ago.</p>

<p>As none of the aforementioned members represented the VPCC on-field at the Australasian Police Cricket Carnivals they have not been allocated a players number.  They have however thrived in the successes of the club as if they had scored that last run or taken that last wicket.  It is because of men like these, performing the audacious task of administrator over the years, that has enabled this club to thrive and for that we are all eternally grateful.</p>

<p>In 1995/96 Wayne Stokes and Stewart McConachy were both awarded Life Membership.  Wayne is the longest serving member of the VPCC.  He has played at every Australasian Police Cricket Carnival (15 in total) since its inception in 1977 and attended both International Police Cricket Festivals which the club has attended (and even one the club didn’t).  His contribution and longevity to the club is unparalleled anywhere.  He is simply known as a legend in Australasian Police Cricket Carnival circles and shows no intent on slowing down yet.  He is VPCC player number 1.  He has played more games than anyone else, punched more runs than anyone else and simply become an icon of the club.  He was secretary of the club in 1987/88 and 1988/89 before taking over the role of Treasurer in 1989/90 for six seasons.  Wayne also captained the team for the 1993/94 season.  Since the honour of Life Membership was bestowed upon him he has taken on the role of Vice President in 1997/98 and 1998/99 and again performed Secretarial duties in 1999/00 and 2000/01.  Wayne again took on the reigns of Vice President in 2003/04 and remains in this position today.</p>  

<p>Stuey’s on field career too has endured longevity, captaining one of the club’s mid-week teams for seven consecutive years winning many premierships along the way.  Stuey was a driving force behind the development of the VPCC and ensured it’s dominance as a sporting club within the Force.  Stuey was club Vice President for a staggering 11 years from 1986/87 until 1996/97, and still holds the record for the longest serving member of the executive.  The time he has given to the club can never be measured and his immense contribution can be attributed to the formation of the club as it stands today.</p>  

<p>In 2004/05 probably two of the most important club members to have ever represented the ‘big V’ were recognised.  David Jakobi and John O’Connor are both synonymous with success and have served the VPCC with distinction.  ‘Jako’ was club captain for six seasons between 1991/92 and 1997/98.  He played in seven Australasian Police Cricket Carnivals and won four championships in which he captained two.  He has been selected in the All-Australasian team on three occasions (named as captain once) and has won the club championship.  Jako’s on-field leadership certainly inspired the VPCC’s domination of the APCC.  In addition, not only did he fill the incredibly large shoes left by the abdicating President Bluey Fountain in 1997/98 but after nine seasons Jako became the longest serving President of the VPCC.  He also assumed the role of Treasurer for two seasons from 2003/04 to 2004/05.  His contribution to the club and the game has been incredulous.</p>

 <p>Joc’s record too is voluminous.  He was club captain in 1994/95 and again at the clubs first appearance at the International Police Cricket Festival in 2001.  He played in seven Australasian Police Cricket Carnivals and won three APCC championships.  He has been selected in the All-Australasian team and won the club championship on three occasions.  His ability to recruit and mentor members both on and off field has contributed to the enormous success of the club and his leadership is also exemplified by the clubs dominance at the APCC.  He was Vice President from 1999/00 to 2002/03.  His continued involvement with the club is extremely valued.</p>


<p>In 2006/07 Warren Ladgrove became the latest person to receive the honour of Life Membership.  Warren’s contribution to the club on field is outstanding as the best wicket keeper/batsman seen by the club.  He played in seven Australasian Police Cricket Carnivals and won three APCC championships as yet another member of the clubs dominant era.  He has been selected in the All-Australasian team on four occasions.  Warren became club Secretary in 1995/96, his wife becoming club Treasurer the same year.  After four years in this role Warren relinquished his role as Secretary and himself became club Treasurer in 2000/01 until 2002/03.  Warren’s commitment and passion for the club was the driving force in pursuing a new direction with the START Program, after the club’s subsequent withdrawal from the diminishing mid-week competition in the late 1990’s.  As a result of Warren’s foresight the club is now flourishing.</p>


		<h2>Office Bearers</h2>


		<p>The Victoria Police Cricket Club holds an Annual General Meeting in August of each year where office bearers are voted in and various issues are discussed. This meeting is open to all financial members of the Club.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>

	
	<h2>Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships</h2>

	<p>One of the Club’s primary functions is to compete in the biennial Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships.</p>

	<p>In 1977 Canberra held the inaugural Australasian Police Cricket Carnival in commemoration of their 50th year anniversary.  Five teams took part at this event: ACT, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria.  New South Wales eventually won this first Championship with Victoria being runners-up.It was decided among the clubs to continue this incredibly successful Championship on a bi-ennial basis with each club alternating as host.</p>  

	<p>There are currently six core teams competing for the title with New Zealand and Western Australia having since joined the competition.</p>

	<p>Since 1977 a total of 15 Carnivals have been held across Australasia:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>1977 – Canberra</li>
			<li>1979 – Gold Coast*</li>
			<li>1981 – Adelaide</li>
			<li>1983 – Sydney</li>
			<li>1984 – Melbourne*</li>
			<li>1986 – Darwin*</li>
			<li>1988 – Sydney</li>
			<li>1990 – Sunshine Coast*</li>
			<li>1995 – Christchurch</li>
			<li>1997 – Melbourne*</li>
			<li>1999 – Brisbane*</li>
			<li>2002 – Adelaide</li>
			<li>2004 – Sydney</li>
			<li>2006 – Christchurch</li>
			<li>2009 – Perth</li>
			<li>2011 – Melbourne*</li>
			<li>2012 – Gold Coast</li>
			<li>2015 – Auckland</li>
			<li>2016 - Adelaide</li>
		</ul>


	<p>Victoria has won* a total of seven Championships and built both strong rapport as well as a fierce rivalry with many teams.</p>


	<p>The standard of cricket provides for a wide scale of skills and abilities.  Teams have comprised of previous and current national Test players, first class players, first grade players and local club cricketers.  This competition is a great leveller for all standards of play and can certainly bring the best out of everyone.  It is not incumbent that players be outstanding grade cricketers, more importantly is simply the desire to participate.  Most state’s team comprises cricketers from all these aforementioned levels with some notable differences each Carnival.</p>

	<p>Outside of the playing arena, the social interaction is definitely first class.  Cricket can be both intense or played in a relaxed state with team interaction assured at post match celebrations.  Interstate networking is very much encouraged and many a life long friend can be made.  Social functions, team dinners and a presentation evening are all on the week’s agenda.</p>

	<p>Carnivals will generally fixture games Sunday to Friday with a mid-week rest day for that well earned break or sight seeing.  This enables players to travel interstate while maintaining their own club cricket commitments.  Travel arrangements are reflected by members desire not to miss their own club matches on Saturday.  The current number of teams ensures a round-robin tournament with the winner finishing highest on the table.  Finals are no longer played.</p>


	<p>Individual awards are bestowed upon outstanding performances in addition to the Championship Shield for the winning club.  At the conclusion of each Carnival, the A.P.C.C. Executive selects an Australasian Representative side, reflective of individual achievements during the week.</p> 

	<p>The following Victorian members have been recognised in the Australasian Merit Team at the following carnivals:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>1998 - J. O’Connor, W. Ladgrove, A. Fincher, D. Jakobi</li>
			<li>1990 - D. Jakobi, C. Harris, W. Ladgrove</li>
			<li>1992: P. Radford</li>
			<li>1995: W. Stokes, W. Ladgrove, S. Siede</li>
			<li>1997:	D. Jakobi, W. Ladgrove, R. Howland, J. Traplin</li>
			<li>1999:	R. Howland, C. Harris, A. Huntington</li>
			<li>2002: S. Rainey</li>
			<li>2004: M. Thomas</li>
			<li>2006: W. Stokes, C. Hill</li>
			<li>2006: W. Stokes, C. Hill</li>
			<li>2006: W. Stokes, C. Hill</li>
			<li>2006: W. Stokes, C. Hill</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note:  This was not awarded prior to 1988.</p>

		<h3>The Ron Howland Memorial Award</h3>

<p>Ron Howland represented the Victoria Police Cricket Club with distinction over many years in the Metropolitan Mid-Week Cricket Association, the 'START' program and at six Australasian Police Cricket Championships.  Ron also toured Sri Lanka in 1997 with the Australasian Police XI</p>

<p>Ron's cricketing highlights also include touring Pakistan with the Australian under 19 team and subsequently being named Young Australian Cricketer of the Year.  Ron went on to forge out an outstanding senior cricket career with V.C.A. clubs Essendon and Hawthorn and then Sub-District clubs Oakleigh and Malvern.  Ron was further selected to play in Sub-District Association representative teams.</p>

<p>Tragically Ron's life was cut short on March 14th 2000, when he succumbed to injuries sustained in a motor cycle accident.  He was 37.</p>

<p>At Ron's last carnival in Brisbane 1999 he was awarded the Victoria Police Cricket Club's highest individual award for the best player. The Victoria Police Cricket Club re-named it's trophy for the most outstanding player in recognition of Ron Howland’s contribution to the VPCC.  It is awarded to the best-performed Victorian player during the Australasian Police Cricket Championships.  As one of Victoria Police Cricket Clubs' most outstanding players, respected and admired by all, this award is held in the highest regard.</p>


	


		<h3>A.N.Z.P.C.C. Life Membership</h3>

	<p>Life Membership is bestowed upon exceptionally worthy recipients who epitomise the Carnival spirit through their contribution, dedication and commitment.  Victoria Police Cricket Club life member Wayne Stokes was among the first to be honoured with this prestigious accolade considered to be an outstanding candidate by The A.P.C.C. Executive as the only member across Australia to have participated at every carnival.</p>



		<h3>International Police Cricket Festival</h3>

	<p>There have been four International Police Cricket Festival’s since its inception; derived as the brain child of a recidivist world touring cricket team from Worcester in the U.K.  Teams from all over the world are encouraged and invited to play in the relevant competition generally held every three years.  Festivals have generally been two solid weeks of playing and travel arrangements generally allow for recuperation and training days.</p>  

	<p>The V.P.C.C. has participated in two Festivals: Perth 2001 and Worcester 2004.  A shortage of players is the primary reason why the club finished equal third in 2001, (a tremendous effort), and fifth in 2004, (winning a play-off final on the last day). </p> 

	<p>The Festival is mostly made up of teams from the U.K., the West Indies, South Africa and Australia.  Some of the teams are very professional in their approach with corporate sponsorship and departmental support.  Other teams however pay their own way, in their own time.</p>

 	 	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p class="Mission">The Victoria Police Cricket Club was initally formed in 1977 to compete in the Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships. Today, another function is to participate in community engagement events designed to enhance the relationship between Victoria Police and the wider community.</p>
		<p class="Mission">Cricket is a platform to engage with a cross-section of Victorians particularly the culturally, linguistically and religiously diverse communities and these events encourage camaraderie and  physical fitness amongst police members and project a favourable image of Victoria Police. Additionally we seek to to promote and encourage sportsmanship, a sense of fair play and the game of cricket itself.</p>
		<p class="Mission">Victoria Police Cricket Club was named the Most Outstanding Sports Club at Victoria Police Amateur Sports and Welfare Society Awards in 2015 and received the Police Media Multicultural Award at Victoria's Multicultural Awards for Excellence in 2016.</p>

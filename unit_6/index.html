 		<h2>The Luke Batty Memorial Shield</h2>

		<p>The Luke Batty Memorial Shield, a T20 cricket match against the Tyabb Cricket Club,was instigated by the VPCC to raise awareness of the issue of domestic violence in the community and also to honour the memory of Luke Batty who was killed by his father just over two years earlier whilst he trained in the nets with his friends and Tyabb CC team mates.</p>

		<p>The match gave the local community another chance to come together to remember Luke but also to celebrate the game of cricket.</p>
